<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great apps that enable you to eat healthy, make grocery shopping easier, or help you live a more environment-friendly lifestyle. I built this app to accomplish all three!

Here's why:
* Eating healthy is hard enough as is. It takes lots of effort to learn which foods to eat, how much to eat, how to cook such food, and how to turn all this effort into a sustainable habit. :muscle:
* Eating healthy can be expensive! The last thing you want to do after buying increasingly expensive groceries is to throw out unused food. :moneybag:
* Planning, Cooking, Eating, and Grocery Shopping takes a lot of time! If only you could accomplish all these tasks making more time for things in life that matter- Gen AI. (todo -change) :smile:

Of course, no app is 100% complete and bug free. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have and will contribute to this app!
